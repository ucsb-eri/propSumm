# propSumm

Assembling proposal summary data.  Maybe provide some graphs.

At this point we need to sort out what the specific goals are:
+ graphs?
+ reports?
+ how to summarize the data?

Potential issues:
+ Do we need to see changes from one data import to the next?
  + If so:
    + we need a viable key (or pair of fields to act as a key)
    + what fields do we compare to to determine whether the data is updated or not
